Js Project Proposal

Background
My project will be a data visualization of the game Valorant. The project will showcase an overview of the characters, their background and their abilities and traits. The project would also showcase all the different maps the game has to offer. Overall the general idea is this project should be able to give a quick demonstration of what the game Valorant has to offer.

Functionality & MVPs
In { Valolytics }, users will be able to:
{ 4-6 core features or functionalities of your project }
{ interactive buttons for users to click and render character info such as abilities }
{ see most updated data being pulled from a api }
{ search up characters to see specific characters info }
{ interactive buttons or slider to show case all the maps the game has to offer }

In addition, this project will include:
{ 2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README }
{ a interactive weapons menu that shows weapon price }
{ a damage comparison chart that has a drag down menu for gun damage comparisons or graph }

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
I will be primarily using this api (https://dash.valorant-api.com/endpoints/agents) to fetch my data and vanilla javascript to implement functionalities for users to interact with.

Implementation Timeline
Friday Afternoon & Weekend : hoping to finish writing my scripts, getting my fetched data to show up on my html and my buttons and search to work as intended.

Monday : hoping if the functionalities are working and data is being fetched properly start working on css

Tuesday : css making it better and more detailed or catching up if things didnâ€™t go as planned

Wednesday: hopefully css is looking somewhat decent and I can consider fixing it so it is good for mobile view

Thursday Morning: Hopefully by now my project should be showing decent css and functionalities ^^
